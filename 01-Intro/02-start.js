/*
    ? Correct way:
    - Add dependencies: [npm i react && npm i react-dom] React & ReactDOM
    - Import React from 'react' and ReactDOM from 'react-dom'.
    !ðŸ‘Œ React is what defines JSX, so we need to import React in order to write JSX syntax.

    * Challenge:
    > Find out what happens if we try to append JSX to our div#root using .append() instead of ReactDOM.render():
    - See if you can guess what will show up in the browser before running the code
    // [object Object] which is a string representation of the regular JS object returned by JSX.
    - See if you can explain what actually shows up in the browser.
    ! The plain JS object returned by JSX isn't recognized by the browser!
    ðŸ‘Œ Only React takes these kinds of objects and turns them into real DOM elements that the browser can interpret.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const html = document.getElementById('root');

const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <p> We are available</p>
  </div>
);

// html.append(element); //! [object Object]
// html.append(JSON.stringify(element)); //! Show it in details

ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));

//* React 18 ðŸ˜˜
ReactDOM
    .createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
    .render(element);
