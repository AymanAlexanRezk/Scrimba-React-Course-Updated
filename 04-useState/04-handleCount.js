  ! A common misconception that React beginners tend to fall into:
  > ++stateVar OR stateVar++.
  ðŸ‘‰ In the philosophy of React, this is strictly forbidden because we never modify state directly.
  - count++ => count = count + 1
  - The entire reason we have setCount() function is to simply provide a new updated value.
  - This setCount() that we can run, and whatever value we provide is going to be the newer version of state.

  * Running the function immediately after generating state won't work:
  - setCount(count + 1); //// We can't simply do[change] state, Instead ðŸ‘‡
  > We are given a function that allows us to make these changes so that React can handle those changes accordingly.
  - Takes a value as a new version of the state [when something specific happen on the page].
