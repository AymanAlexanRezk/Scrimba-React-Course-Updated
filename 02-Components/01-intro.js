/*
    ? React Custom Components:
    > React adapted the concept of function which allows us to write and execute code over and over.
    - We can then have functions that once executed will return our UIs/elements.
    üëå A function that [returns React elements] is considered [in React] a component.

    * Conventions to follow for writing a correct React custom component:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Use PascalCase instead of camelCase for naming your React custom components
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Wrap your React custom component in angle brackets instead of calling it as in regular JS.
    üëå It will look like an [self closing] HTML element.
    üòé This is how we call our React component, creating an instance of the component by rendering it.
