    ? Array .map():
    > It takes a regular data and turns it into JSX elements that can be displayed on the screen.
  
    > JSX returns a regular JS object.
    üëâ The properties/shape of this object get determined by React in order to describe the element that React eventually will be turning into a real DOM node that shows up on the screen.

    > React renders arrays:
    üëå React's special feature:
    - If we provide an array into which we are rendering from a component, React will know how to essentially map over that array and turn it into element.
    - We can tell React if we want this array to be paragraphs, headers, lists, ..
    üëâ React can render an array of JSX elements.

    ? Notes:
    > Loading images from .map():
    - Put your images folder @public folder.

    > Any time we use .map() on data to create JSX => KEY IS NEEDED.
    - Set the key to something unique for each item in the list.
    - Ex, key={item.id}, Data bases is creating that as a unique property for us.

    > What does the `.map()` array method do?
    - Returns a brand new array. Whatever gets returned from the callback function provided is placed at the same index in the new array.
    - Usually we take the items from the original array and modify them in some way.

    > What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?
    - Convert an array of raw data, usually array of objects, into an array of JSX elements that can be displayed on the page.

    > Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components
    - Manually by typing them out? It makes our code more "self-sustaining" and dry.
    - Not requiring additional changes whenever the data changes.
    - Similar to using array.length in loops, to track any inserted data to the array so that we do loop over any new data automatically.
    - Mapping over our data, if the data ever changes, our page will automatically updates.
